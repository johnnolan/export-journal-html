# Export Journal to HTML

A system agnostic way of exporting FoundryVTT Journal entries to HTML for printing or generating a PDF.

## Setup and use

- Enable the module
- On Text Journal Entries, click on the print icon
- A pop up will appear with the Journal content in
- Print the page and choose Destination as `Print to PDF`

Print Icon Example

[![Print Icon Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/export-journal-html/main/images/print-icon.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/export-journal-html/main/images/print-icon.jpg)

## Options

If you are viewing pages in the `View Multiple Pages` journal view then all text type pages will be exported.

If you are viewing single pages then only that page will print.

By default, the output will look like this

[![Standard Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/export-journal-html/main/images/standard.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/export-journal-html/main/images/standard.jpg)

### Remove images on background

Removes the background images leaving you with a white background.

## Add custom CSS

This allows you to set override CSS rules for the final export. You may need to set the `!important` attribute on your rules for them to take effect.

e.g. `body { background-color: red !important; }` will give the following look.

## Key things this module changes on export

- Tries to correctly link any images in CSS and HTML
- Replaces any `@UUID` links with the label in them

## Known Issues

- If you don't see anything, it could be your adblocker. Check that it is not blocking popups for your foundry site
- The standalone windows application will prompt you to download and not show a popup. I recommend using a browser to log in to do the export for now

## Bugs

There most definitely will be layout issues and broken links. Please ensure you send the following with any bug report

1. A screenshot of the output if any is generated
2. A screenshot the the content in the Journal view
3. The HTML of the Journal causing issues
